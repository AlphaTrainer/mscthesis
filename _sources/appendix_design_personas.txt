.. Some nice guidelines for writing up a persona:

.. - A model of a person, an example.  ..
.. - includes demographic information, but should also capture a person's
..   motivation, beliefs, intentions, behavior and goals ..
.. - Draw a picture of your persona or use a photo ..
.. - give him or her a name, an occupation, a background, a social
..   situation, some hopes, dreams, and goals etc. Give the persona a
..   story to tell
