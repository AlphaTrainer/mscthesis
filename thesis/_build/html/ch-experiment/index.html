<p>This chapter addresses <strong>G1</strong> (Section&nbsp;<a class="reference internal" href="../ch-intro/index.html#ch-intro-hypothesis-goals">1.2</a>)
by evaluating 3 of the consumer BCIs presented in the Background Chapter&nbsp;<a class="reference internal" href="../ch-background/index.html#ch-background">2</a>: EPOC (Section&nbsp;<a class="reference internal" href="../ch-background/index.html#ch-background-epoc">2.2.1</a>), MindWave (Section&nbsp;<a class="reference internal" href="../ch-background/index.html#ch-background-mindwave">2.2.2</a>) and TrueSense Kit (Section&nbsp;<a class="reference internal" href="../ch-background/index.html#ch-background-truesense-kit">2.2.3</a>).  The BCIs are evaluated based on their
feasibility for alpha feedback training and finally in the conclusion of this
chapter we will select a BCI to use in the further development of
AlphaTrainer. This conclusion will be based on several aspects such as comfort
and connectivity. However, the main effort of this chapter is put into answering
the least accessible - and arguably the most important - factor: &quot;<em>are the
BCIs able to measure alpha waves</em>&quot;?</p>
<p>In designing an experiment to answer this, we did a
pre-study which is explained in the next section. After that we move on to
explain the setup, execution and data analysis of the actual experiment.</p>
<p><strong>Method</strong></p>
<p>To answer whether a BCI can measure alpha, we exploit the property of alpha
activity, that it is generally higher when eyes are closed compared to when eyes
are open&nbsp;<span class="citation">[<a class="reference internal" href="../bibliography.html#citation-bazanova-comments-2012">9</a><span class="citation">]</span></span>.  By comparing alpha levels
recorded under a closed-eyes condition to alpha levels recorded under an
open-eyes condition, we get a measure of how able a BCI is to detect alpha
activity.</p>
<div class="section" id="pre-study">
<span id="ch-experiment-pre-study"></span><h2>3.1 Pre-study<a class="headerlink" href="#pre-study" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The first BCI we got our hands on was the MindWave. Eager to find out
whether it could measure alpha levels, we implemented a simple proof-of-concept
prototype (explained in more detail in Chapter&nbsp;<a class="reference internal" href="../ch-design/index.html#ch-design">4</a>) able
to store SDK alpha values (high and low alpha bands) as well as the
raw EEG signal. To get an initial idea whether the headset could measure
alpha, we used this prototype to record and compare SDK alpha values under
closed and open-eyes condition. Concretely, we performed some recordings
in which a test subject would have open eyes the first half and closed
eyes the last half of the recording. Figure&nbsp;<a href="#fig-mindwave-sdk-values">3.1</a>
shows two plots of SDK values recorded in this way - the plot on the right
has a y-axis limit while the plot on the left
shows the actual values.</p>

</div>
<p class="caption"><strong>Figure 3.1:</strong> Two plots of the same MindWave SDK alpha powers with/without zoom.</p>
</div><p id="fig-mindwave-sdk-values">The plot is representative for many similar recordings we performed and show some giant
outliers in the SDK values. Similar outliers were present in the other power
bands as well. To find out whether the outliers originated from the raw data or
the SDK data processing, we applied offline frequency analysis to the raw data
in Octave&nbsp;<a class="footnote-reference" href="#foot-experiment-octave" id="id1"><sup>2</sup></a> - an open-source equivalent to
MATLAB.  We were not able to reproduce the outliers which means they were not
present in the raw data. We initiated a correspondence with NeuroSky technicians
(see Appendix&nbsp;<a class="reference internal" href="../appendix_experiment_mindwave_fora_posts.html#appendix-experiment-mindwave-fora-posts"><em>MindWave forum posts</em></a>) but they
were unable to pinpoint the origin of the outliers in spite of receiving both
SDK values and the originating raw data. They were also unable to disclose how
the SDK values are calculated due to the closed source nature of their SDK.</p>
<p>In the process of investigating the origin of the outliers, we also suspected
EMG and EOG noise. This led us to compare recordings in which we induced such
noise to recordings where we minimized it as much as possible by relaxing facial
muscles and avoiding eye movement.  While this did not prevent the outliers, it
showed a significant impact of the noise in the form of a general increase in band power
across all frequency bands. This led us to the insight that we would need to
minimize facial muscles and eye movement in the actual experiment as much as
possible.</p>
<p>From this point, we cleaned the MindWave SDK data by replacing the outliers with
the mean value of the non-outliers. We carried on the recordings to compare the
alpha levels when eyes are open to when they are closed. A representative plot
of the resulting data can be seen in Figure&nbsp;<a href="#fig-early-open-closed-experiments">3.2</a>.  In this case we recorded for 4
minutes and summed the alpha levels in bins of 2 seconds. As exemplified in the
plot, we measured a clear tendency of an increase in alpha when the test subject
closed the eyes at the midpoint of the recording.</p>

</div><p id="fig-early-open-closed-experiments">To avoid dependencies on black box SDK calculations and to get comparable
results across different BCIs, we chose to rely only on our own signal
processing from this point.  Both the TrueSense Kit and the EPOC (research
edition) BCIs support raw EEG out of the box through their bundled software OPI
Console and TestBench (Appendix&nbsp;<a class="reference internal" href="../appendix_background_truesense_console.html#appendix-background-truesense-console"><em>TrueSense Kit console</em></a> and Appendix&nbsp;<a class="reference internal" href="../appendix_background_testbench.html#appendix-background-testbench"><em>Emotiv EPOC TestBench</em></a>).</p>
<p>Next step was to select which of the 16 electrode(s) to use from the EPOC
headset. We chose to use one of the electrodes placed at location O1 or O2 (back
of the head) - the electrodes used in the Smartphone Brain Scanner alpha
feedback training application&nbsp;<span class="citation">[<a class="reference internal" href="../bibliography.html#citation-stopczynski-smartphones-2013">59</a><span class="citation">]</span></span>. This placement has the advantage of
little EOG and EMG noise (which we tested by comparing recordings from different
electrodes while introducing eye movement and facial muscle activation). We did
not experience significant difference between the two channels and we decided to
use only the O1 electrode in order to make sure results could be directly
compared to the results of the other single channel BCIs.</p>
<p>Furthermore we had to decide the placement of the TrueSense Kit BCI. It features
flexible mounting by its small size and elastic band mount, so placement is not
obvious. To obtain the advantages of recording from the back of the head, we
tried mounting the sensor on top of the neck hair at O1. This gave us very noisy
data both in the dry and the gel-pad electrode configuration probably due to low
scalp conductivity. The same was the case when trying to place the sensor on the
temple. We ended up placing the sensor at the side of the forehead as
recommended by TrueSense Kit for measuring alpha&nbsp;<a class="footnote-reference" href="#foot-experiment-opi-wearsensor" id="id2"><sup>1</sup></a>. Finally, we decided to record the TrueSense
Kit over radio (ZigBee) rather than to the memory module attachable to the
sensor. The latter would presumably give better
recording quality. However, in a neurofeedback context offline
recording is not relevant since the data must be fed into the feedback
mechanism instantly.</p>
<p>This concludes the pre-study which incrementally has led to all the building
blocks necessary for designing an experiment which will answer whether the BCIs
of interest can measure alpha.</p>

<h2>3.2 Experiment design<a class="headerlink" href="#experiment-design" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This section formalizes the design of our experiment which will
answer to which degree the BCIs can measure alpha from guidelines
by MacKenzie&nbsp;<span class="citation">[<a class="reference internal" href="../bibliography.html#citation-mackenzie-human-computer-2013">42</a><span class="citation">]</span></span>.
Revisiting our
method, it is assumed that alpha levels are higher when eyes are
closed than when eyes are open. From this assumption, we reach
the hypothesis tested in the experiment:</p>
<p>H1</p>
<blockquote>
<div>The EEG recorded while eyes are closed contains higher alpha levels
than EEG recorded while eyes are open.</div></blockquote>
<p>The independent variables (factors) of the experiment are the <em>eye states</em>:
(<em>i</em>) open; and (<em>ii</em>) closed. The dependent variable is simply the alpha
level. The task of the participants is to relax as much as possible (keep
blink, face muscles and eye-movement at a minimum). We did a pilot experiment on
our selves and on a domain expert within experimental psychology to catch
potential problems which led to a slight refining of the execution procedure.
We later carried out the experiment on 6 participants (4 males and 2 females).</p>
<p>To ensure that we would not only measure a precedence effect or some other
learning effect - i.e. gaining familiarity with wearing a brain interface and
thus being increasingly comfortable and relaxed (which minimizes EMG and EOG
noise) - we varied the BCI recording order as lined out in Table&nbsp;<a href="#table-experiment-headset-latin-square">3.3</a>. We now describe in more detail
the execution of the experiment.</p>

</div><p id="fig-experiment-setup">Before entering the recording room, the participant was instructed in a
breathing exercise to help her relax. The exercise consisted of breathing slowly
through the nose while continuously counting 1 down when exhaling. The count
down starts from 4 and whenever 0 is reached it starts over from 4.</p>
<p>The procedure for each participant - BCI combination was this:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The participant entered the recording room, sat down and got a headset mounted.</li>
<li>The participant was instructed to sit still, keep eye movement and
blinking to a minimum, relax face muscles and to do the simple
breathing exercise instructed earlier.</li>
<li>The participant was instructed to focus at a specific point in the image
when having open eyes (to hold visual stimuli constant across all participants and
headsets).</li>
<li>3 times in a row, we recorded for 5 minutes. After 2.5 minutes
the participant is instructed verbally to close or open her eyes.</li>
</ul>
<p>This procedure was repeated until all 3 BCIs had been recorded.
After each session (3 recordings with the same headset) we asked
the participant: (<em>i</em>) &quot;<em>how relaxed did you feel during the recordings
from 1 to 10, where 10 is very relaxed?</em>&quot;; and (<em>ii</em>) &quot;<em>how comfortable was
it to wear the headset from 1 to 10, where 10 is very comfortable?</em>&quot;. The
results of this questionnaire are listed in Table&nbsp;<a href="#table-experiment-final-relaxed-comfort">3.5</a>. They indicate that
TrueSense Kit is the most comfortable BCI to wear and that the EPOC and
MindWave BCIs are both &quot;medium&quot; comfortable. The results also indicates

<p>From the 5 minutes recorded, we extract 2 minutes of open eyes and 2 minutes of
closed eyes - thus discarding a 15 second margin on either side of each
extraction. These two extractions are subject for the frequency comparison.</p>
<p>For frequency estimation, we use the <em>P.D. Welch algorithm</em> which cuts up the data
in small time windows and for each frequency in each window the density of that
frequency is calculated/estimated using FFT&nbsp;<span class="citation">[<a class="reference internal" href="../bibliography.html#citation-welch-use-1967">68</a><span class="citation">]</span></span>. These frequency densities are then squared and summed
up within a frequency band resulting in a total estimation of the power of that
frequency band in the input signal (Appendix&nbsp;<a class="reference internal" href="../appendix_experiment.html#appendix-experiment"><em>Experiment - signal processing</em></a>).</p>
<p>We compare alpha levels between the open/closed eyes conditions in two ways:
(<em>i</em>) Direct comparison by dividing alpha band power under closed-eyes condition
with alpha band power under open-eyes condition. This is how the alpha band
power is calculated in the Smartphone Brain Scanner alpha feedback training
experiment&nbsp;<span class="citation">[<a class="reference internal" href="../bibliography.html#citation-stopczynski-smartphones-2013">59</a><span class="citation">]</span></span>. We call this the
&quot;<em>absolute alpha</em>&quot; measure. (<em>ii</em>) We also compare the relative alpha levels of
each condition. The relative alpha level is found by dividing the alpha band
power with a broad &quot;total&quot; band power (in our case 5 Hz - 25 Hz) to get a
measure of how much the total band power is made up of alpha. Dividing the
relative alpha level under closed-eyes condition with the relative alpha level
under open-eyes condition gives us the &quot;<em>relative alpha</em>&quot; measure. This approach
is used in&nbsp;<span class="citation">[<a class="reference internal" href="../bibliography.html#citation-finnigan-resting-2011">24</a><span class="citation">]</span></span> to estimate theta band power.</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-eq-absolute-alpha">
<span class="eqno">(1)</span>\[\alpha_\textrm{absolute} = \frac{\sum \alpha_\textrm{closed eyes}} {\sum \alpha_\textrm{open eyes}}\]</div>
<div class="math" id="equation-eq-relative-alpha">
<span class="eqno">(2)</span>\[\alpha_\textrm{relative} = \frac{\dfrac{\sum \alpha_\textrm{closed eyes}}{\sum \textrm{ EEG power closed eyes} }}{\dfrac{\sum \alpha_\textrm{open eyes}}{ \sum \textrm{EEG power open eyes}}}\]</div>
<p>The absolute alpha measure compares the alpha levels under each condition
(open/closed eyes) isolated from the total EEG power level (Equation&nbsp;<a href="#equation-eq-absolute-alpha">1</a>). The relative alpha measure will account for the total
EEG power by comparing alpha relative to the total EEG power under each
condition (Equation&nbsp;<a href="#equation-eq-relative-alpha">2</a>). We expect the latter to be the most
reliable measure of alpha in that it will be more resistant to EMG/EOG noise
(under the assumption that such noise will raise the overall EEG power level
somewhat evenly which matches our observations from recordings under induced EMG
and EOG).</p>
<p>We did some simple filtering by discarding bins where the alpha or total band
power deviates from mean by more than 4 * std.dev.  In these cases, the power
would mainly origin from EMG/EOG. For each headset, this cleaning excluded 2 of
the 18 recordings.  The mean values ± standard deviation are listed in Table&nbsp;<a href="#table-experiment-final-result-mean">3.6</a>. The mean value of the absolute
and relative alpha measures inform about the degree to which a higher alpha
level has been detected under closed-eyes condition.  The standard deviation
informs about the consistency of the recording measure and BCI combination
(lower std.dev. means more consistent).  The resulting data suggests:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The EPOC and MindWave BCIs can detect alpha (mean is &gt; 1).</li>
<li>The EPOC headset detect the most alpha.</li>
<li>The relative alpha measure is the most reliable (i.e. lower std.dev.) as
expected.</li>
<li>The TrueSense Kit sensor only shows a vague difference in alpha between the
two conditions which is unlikely to be
sufficient for alpha feedback training. Furthermore Figure&nbsp;<a href="#fig-experiment-final-7-truesense-alpha-power">3.7f</a> exemplifies the general tendency that
the recordings of TrueSense Kit are noisy and lack the expected alpha peak
under closed-eyes condition. The narrow peak around 12,5 Hz is likely to be
some power grid noise being picked up (which we experienced a lot with the
TrueSense Kit). Figure&nbsp;<a href="#fig-experiment-final-13-truesense-alpha-power">3.8f</a> also
show noisy data from the TrueSense Kit. In this case we see a lot of
low frequency noise and its harmonics - the series of peaks appearing approximately
every 3 Hz. This noise pattern is roughly the same under
open and closed eyes conditions which indicates that the main source of the
recording is not EEG (i.e. the alpha peak is missing).</li>
</ul>
<p>Figure&nbsp;<a href="#fig-final-experiment-recording-7">3.7</a> and
Figure&nbsp;<a href="#fig-final-experiment-recording-13">3.8</a> show recordings of each
BCI for two different participants. They exemplify how the alpha peak varies
between individuals. For example, Participant 3 has an alpha peak under
closed-eyes condition around 10.5 Hz while participant 5 has one around 11.5 Hz.</p>

<span id="fig-final-experiment-recording-13"></span><h2>3.3 Choice of BCI<a class="headerlink" href="#choice-of-bci" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>We have lined up the parameters of the evaluation in Table&nbsp;<a href="#table-bci-evaluation">3.9</a>. We choose the MindWave BCI in the further
development of AlphaTrainer because: (<em>i</em>) it can detect alpha; (<em>ii</em>) it does
not require assistance or preparation time to use; (<em>iii</em>) it supports Bluetooth
communication; finally (<em>ii-ii</em>) it has out of the box SDK support for mobile
devices including access to raw EEG data.</p>
<p>The rationale behind these arguments is based on our overall method which
includes building a system deployable for actual use. In a research context (or
any context requiring spatial resolution), the EPOC is an excellent choice. And
in a quantified-self context in which offline recording and processing is
possible, the TrueSense Kit is the obvious choice due to its size and comfort.</p>
<p>Another advantage of the MindWave is that it seems to best represent the future
of consumer BCIs. As mentioned in Section&nbsp;<a class="reference internal" href="../ch-background/index.html#ch-background-future-headsets">2.2.4</a>, the next generation of consumer BCIs
feature Bluetooth connectivity and a dry sensor configuration. By using MindWave
in the further development of AlphaTrainer, we are best prepared for adapting to
future BCIs.</p>
